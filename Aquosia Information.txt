Welcome to Aquosia - Temple of the Water God
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a project I've been working on for a while. I've grown quite fond of using invisible blocks to make Floating Water so I kicked it up a notch and had it float a few island.. The project features 6 islands floating around a spherical/gyroscopic "thingy". As well as a large Central island on top of said "thingy".. 

On the islands you will find different types of organic builds I've learned from MrD4nny the most awesome organic builder I know. I had a lot of help from him with the angel statues on the central island. The "Demi" god trees that are all over the build I built myself. I learned how to build them from watching Block_Fortress's godtree tutorial.. I just put my own twist on them.

For those that download the Schematic soon to come you'll be pleased with a little redstone surprise when you make offerings to the 4 water shrines at each corner of the central island.. ^_^ I'll let you experience it yourself. The redstone work comes courtesy of Rukusmon and Fcjr both friends and owners of Vaecon that I play/build on... I thank them very much as I have no redstone skillz....

But ya if you like what I have so far please feel free to Comment, Diamond, and Subscribe.
